Intro Lets create a customer or two, Assuming you have installed and configured, Its time to get the hang of CRUD on your fresh database.
So given we need to store customers in our database, we create customers table, in which we store informations like:
First name Last name Email Age In theory, First Name and Last Name or Email, are a text, in SQL, there is many text types, but to keep it simple we will use VARCHAR, think of it as a string type, but with a predefined max length we provide, 150 in our case is the maximum number of charachters for a first name or last name.</description></item><item><title>The basics</title><link>https://mohamedallam1991.github.io/postgres/basics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 18:36:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://mohamedallam1991.github.io/postgres/basics/</guid><description>Hugo-theme-docdock defines two types of pages. Default and Slide.
Default is the common page like the current one you are reading. Slide is a page that use the full screen to display its markdown content as a reveals.js presentation. HomePage is a special content that will be displayed as home page content. To tell Hugo-theme-docdock to consider a page as a slide, just add a type=&amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;in then frontmatter of your file.</description></item></channel></rss>
